<h1 align="center"> Lithics from the Knapper’s-Eye View</h1>

The best way to learn flintknapping is to do it. The second best way is to see it in action from the knapper's perspective. This website will introduce you to stone tools and provide a sense of the knapper’s perspective and decision-making process. Photos and short videos show basic knapping techniques, including hard hammer percussion, soft hammer percussion, and pressure flaking. Through these examples, you can learn how to identify the processes that past people used to produce the lithic artifacts in the archaeological record. Go to the Resources page to find out more about how you can learn flintknapping.

<h2 align="center"> The Basics</h2>

<b>Lithics</b> are stone tools and the waste products of tool-making process.

<b> Debitage</b> comprises the waste products from the tool-making process. (<i>Debitage</i> comes from the French word for trash.) The most common lithics in the archaeological record are debitage, not tools.

<b>Flintknapping</b> is the process of making stone tools.

The two main classes of lithic technology are flaked/chipped stone and groundstone. <b>Flaked/chipped stone</b> technology involves flaking stone through percussion or pressure. It is used to make tools such as knives, projectile points (spear and arrow points), scrapers, and drills. <b>Groundstone</b> technology involves shaping stone through abrading, polishing or pecking. It is used to make tools such as manos, metates, mortars, pestles, bowls, and axes.

<h3>Flaked/Chipped Stone Technology Basics</h3>

A flintknapper starts with a stone nucleus and removes flakes from the nucleus.

Flaked stone tools are often classified based on how many faces (sides) of the nucleus were flaked [<u>SIB</u>].
- <b>Unifacial</b> tools have flakes removed from one face. [<u>include photo of scraper</u>]
- <b>Bifacial</b> tools have flakes removed from both faces. [<u>include photo of projectile point</u>]

To understand how past people flintknapped stone tools, archaeologists recreate the <b>chaîne opératoire</b>: the operational sequence of making, using, and discarding tools. The step-by-step decisions include acquiring raw materials, making a tool, using the tool, and discarding the tool. Understanding these decisions helps us understand the lives of past people.
