<h1>Learning Flintknapping</h1>

<p>Learning to make stone tools takes practice and patience. Skilled flintknappers make it look easy, so don't be discouraged when you can't make a projectile point on your first try. You will likely gain a great appreciation for what our ancestors accomplished with stone tool technology.</p>

<h2>Safety First</h2>

<p>Be forewarned: Flintknapping extracts a sacrifice of blood. At the same time, you can reduce your blood tribute with some basic precautions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wear long pants and closed-toed shoes. You don't want sharp objects getting into your shoes.</li>
  <li>Protect your eyes with safety glasses.</li>
  <li>Wear leather gloves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Whittaker's handbook explains the process of flintknapping and the principles of fracture mechanics.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">Whittaker, John C. 1994. <i>Flintknapping: Making and Understanding Stone Tools.</i> Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press.</p>

<p>While a handbook is important, there is no substitute for hands-on practice. Get some <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#toolstone" target="_blank">toolstone</a>, a <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#hammer-stone" target="_blank">hammer stone</a> and/or <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#soft-hammer-percussion" target="_blank">soft hammer</a>, a sandstone <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#abrader" target="_blank">abrader</a>, and a <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#pressure-flaker" target="_blank">pressure flaker</a>. The videos on this website will help you learn flintknapping techniques and diagnose problems.</p>

<p>Starter flintknapping kits are available online through companies such as <a href="https://www.goknapping.com/GoKnapping_Kits-Flint_Knapping_Kits.html" target="_blank">GoKnapping.com</a>. (Note that I am providing this website as an example without endorsing this specific company.)</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Keep your body compact and hold the <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#nucleus" target="_blank">nucleus</a> steady by bracing your arm on your leg.</li>
  <li>During percussive flaking, adjust the orientation of the nucleus rather than the direction in which you strike the hammer.</li>
  <li>Think about what you are trying to accomplish with each <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#flake" target="_blank">flake</a> you want to remove and figure out the best way to do it. Patience pays off. This includes taking the time to <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#abrading-platforms" target="_blank">abrade platforms</a>.
