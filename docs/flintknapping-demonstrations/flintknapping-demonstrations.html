<h1>Flintknapping Demonstrations</h1>

<p>These flintknapping demonstrations show the process of making flaked stone tools and the challenges flintknappers face. While I had great respect for the ingenuity of our ancestors before learning flintknapping, trying (and generally failing) to make a biface has only increased my respect for our ancestors. They mastered the art of flintknapping to make the tools they needed to survive.</p>

<p>The demonstration <b>"A Beginner Attempts to Make a Biface"</b> shows the challenges I faced as a beginning flintknapper trying to make a biface. Matthew Des Lauriers, an experienced flintknapper, shows how flintknapping should work in the <b>"A Skilled Flintknapper Makes a Projectile Point"</b> demonstration.</p>
