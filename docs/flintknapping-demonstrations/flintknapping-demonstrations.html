<h1 align="center" id="flintknapping-demonstrations">Flintknapping Demonstrations</h1>

<p>These <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#flintknapping" target="_blank">flintknapping</a> demonstrations show the process of making <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#flaked-stone-technology" target="_blank">flaked stone tools</a> and the challenges flintknappers face. While I had great respect for the ingenuity of our ancestors before learning flintknapping, trying (and generally failing) to make a <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#bifacial-tool" target="_blank">biface</a> has only increased my respect for our ancestors. They mastered the art of flintknapping to make the tools they needed to survive.</p>

<p>The demonstration <b>"A Beginner Attempts to Make a Biface"</b> shows the challenges I faced as a beginning flintknapper trying to make a biface. Matthew Des Lauriers, an experienced flintknapper, shows how flintknapping should work in the <b>"A Skilled Flintknapper Makes a Projectile Point"</b> demonstration.</p>
