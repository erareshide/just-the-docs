<h1>Attempt to Make a Biface</h1>

<p>In this series of videos, I go through the process of attempting to make a biface with an antler billet and run into many problems along the way. I hope that this demonstration helps you appreciate the skills of flintknappers in the past. (Note that I was flintknapping in a park near where people were playing basketball.)</p>

<h2>Part 1: Description of Nodule and Knapping Plans</h2>

<p>I start with an obsidian nodule that has a square margin.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Start Removing Cortex and the Square Margin</h2>

<p>I use a sandstone abrader to prepare platforms. I likely created incipient cones of internal fractures in the nucleus. This will make it harder to predict how the nucleus will fracture.</p>

<h2>Part 3: Biface Thinning and Step Fractures during the Attempt to Remove Cortex</h2>

<p>I continue removing cortex with moderate success.</p>

<h2>Part 4: Remove Cortex and Raise the Margin</h2>

<p>I continue removing cortex and try to "raise the margin" (i.e., adjust the edge so that it is more centered than skewed toward one face of the nucleus). During this process, I face problems with accurately aiming the billet to remove the intended flakes.</p>

<h2>Part 5: Remove Cortex and Attempt to Make the Piece Symmetrical</h2>

<p>I continue removing cortex and try to shape the nucleus into the rough shape of a biface. I remove a troublesome step fracture. I manage to cut myself and pay a small blood sacrifice for my efforts.</p>

<h2>Part 6: Removing Step Fractures, Creating Overshot Flakes, and Attacking the Square Margin</h2>

<p>I successfully remove some step fractures, but also create others. I make some unintended overshot flakes, removing large portions of the nucleus.</p>

<h2>Part 7: Thinning the Biface and Attacking the Square Margin</h2>

<p>I attempt to create biface thinnning flakes and remove the square margin. Unfortunately I also create overshot flakes that make the nucleus rounder and narrower than I had intended.</p>

<h2>Part 8: More Problems with Overshot Flakes and Step Fractures</h2>

<p>At this point, my difficulty with hitting the nucleus with the right amount of force is causing problems. When I hit it too hard, I create overshot flakes. When I hit it too soft, I create step fractures. Neither is helpful when I want to make biface thinning flakes.</p>

<h2>Part 9: Attempt to Thin the Biface</h2>

<p>I try to fix the problems I created and thin the biface, but I have some problems with aiming the billet and create more incipient cones.</p>

<u>video of Part 9</u>

<h2>Part 10: Attempt to Thin the Biface Again</h2>

<p>Aiming the billet precisely becomes more important and more difficult as the nucleus becomes smaller. These difficulties result in my creating more hinge and step fractures.</p>

<u>video of Part 10</u>

<h2>Part 11: Attempt to Thin the Biface, But Then Disaster Strikes...</h2>

<p>In attempting to thin the biface, I create a bending break that splits the biface in two. Oops... At this point, I accept that this biface is not meant to be.</p>
