<h1>Making a Projectile Point</h1>

<p>Matthew Des Lauriers, an experienced flintknapper and anthropology professor at California State University, Northridge, explains the <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#flintknapping" target="_blank">flintknapping</a> process as he makes <a href="/lithics/docs/glossary/#flake" target="_blank">flakes</a>, a scraper, and a projectile point out of mahogany obsidian. He uses a simple flake of obsidian to easily slice through leather. He shows how past flintknappers reworked broken projectile points.</p>
