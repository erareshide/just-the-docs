<h1>Making a Projectile Point</h1>

Matthew Des Lauriers, an experienced flintknapper and anthropology professor at California State University, Northridge, explains the flintknapping process as he makes flakes, a scraper, and a projectile point out of mahogany obsidian. He uses a simple flake of obsidian to easily slice through leather. He shows how past flintknappers reworked broken projectile points.
