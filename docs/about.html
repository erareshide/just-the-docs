<h1>About this Website</h1>

<p>This website grew out of my project for Anthropology 476L: Lithic Analysis during my MA at California State University, Northridge. Matthew Des Lauriers taught us lithic analysis by teaching us flintknapping. Matthew specializes in lithic analysis and has been flintknapping since 1999. We spent most of class outside attempting to fashion tools out of obsidian, flint, chert, and other materials. I had great respect for our ancestors before this class. I have even more respect for them after trying (and generally failing) to produce a functional biface.</p>

<p>To help others understand the flintknapping skills our ancestors developed, I decided to create educational materials. I took photos and made videos of the step-by-step flintknapping process from the knapperâ€™s-eye-view so that people could understand how people in the past created the artifacts that we find today. Joanne Minerbi and Austin Ringelstein contributed to this project. Matthew graciously agreed to let me record a flintknapping demonstration that would would show more advanced techniques than any of us beginning flintknappers could perform.</p>
